and,,
the,,
fact,,
that,,
it,,
had,,
been,,
elevated,,
to,,
the,,
status,,
of,,
a,,

gave,,
a,,
whole,,

to,,

the,,

and,,
before,,
returning,,

travelled,,
around,,
europe,,
studying,,
its,,
major,,
cities,,
the,,
person,,
engaged,,
as,,
the,,

was,,

thus,,
it,,
was,,
that,,
the,,
senate,,
square,,
we,,
know,,
today,,
took,,
form,,
the,,
wooden,,
ulrika,,

following,,
his,,

his,,

had,,
to,,
add,,
four,,
smaller,,

around,,
the,,
central,,
tower,,
because,,
it,,
was,,
felt,,
that,,
without,,
their,,
support,,
it,,
might,,
collapse,,
the,,
fear,,
of,,
a,,
collapse,,
was,,
also,,
the,,
reason,,
for,,

placed,,
